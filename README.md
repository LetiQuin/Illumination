# Illumination
Illumination — a poetic axiom on relational systems by Leticia Quintana, Theorist-Inventor.

When you think axiomatically, everything comes down to relation and context.
I am a systems thinker. I tend to learn from the top down. My mind maps a clean path between each variable. 
Where the solution manifests itself as constraint and variable position. A new path is forged and illuminated.
