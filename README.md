# Illumination
A poetic axiom on relational systems <br>
by Leticia Quintana, Theorist-Inventor. <br>

**Axiom** <br>
When you think axiomatically,
everything resolves into relation and context.
I am a systems thinker.
I learn from the top down.
My mind traces clean paths between variables,
where solutions emerge
as constraints
and positions.
A new path is forged—
not discovered,
but illuminated.
